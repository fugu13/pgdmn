# TODO

## Testing

- [ ] Write property-based tests for DMN round trips (parse -> serialize -> parse should be identity)

### FEAT-002: DMN compatibility checking functions

SQL functions inspired by Kafka Schema Registry compatibility semantics, applied to DMN invocable input and output definitions. These enable versioned evolution of DMN models while verifying that consumers and producers remain compatible.

**Core function:** `dmn_compat(new_model DmnModel, old_models DmnModel[], invocable text) → JSONB`

Compares the input and output definitions of a named invocable across a new model and one or more old models, producing a structured JSONB report.

**Compatibility directions (checked separately for inputs and outputs):**

- **BACKWARD (inputs):** The new invocable accepts all inputs the old one could. Adding optional inputs (with defaults) is allowed; removing or narrowing required inputs is not.
- **FORWARD (inputs):** The old invocable could accept all inputs the new one can. Adding required inputs breaks forward compatibility; removing optional inputs is allowed.
- **FULL (inputs):** Both backward and forward — only optional-with-default fields may be added or removed.
- **BACKWARD (outputs):** Consumers of the old outputs can still consume the new outputs. Removing output fields or widening types breaks backward output compatibility.
- **FORWARD (outputs):** Consumers of the new outputs could consume the old outputs. Adding output fields or narrowing types breaks forward output compatibility.
- **FULL (outputs):** Both directions for outputs.

**Report structure (JSONB):** Per old-model entry, per field: field name, direction (input/output), change type (added/removed/type-changed/unchanged), whether the change is backward-compatible, forward-compatible, and a human-readable detail string. Top-level summary booleans for each compatibility mode.

**Array input enables transitive checks:** By passing all historical model versions as the array, the caller gets a report covering compatibility against every prior version, not just the immediately previous one.

**Open design questions:**

- Exact FEEL type compatibility/widening rules (strict equality vs. some form of type promotion)
- Whether to support checking multiple invocables in one call or keep it single-invocable
- How to handle invocables that exist in one model but not the other (report as incompatible vs. skip with warning)

### FEAT-003: Syntax highlighting in code blocks

Add syntax highlighting for SQL and DMN (XML) code examples on the website. Evaluate Rust-side highlighting (e.g. syntect) vs client-side (Prism.js or similar) and choose based on SSR compatibility and bundle size. The SqlBlock component should accept a language parameter to select the grammar.

### FEAT-004: Markdown-based blog infrastructure

Build a blog system for the website that reads markdown files from a directory, renders them as pages, and generates an index with titles and dates.

### FEAT-005: Mobile hamburger menu with focus trapping

The site navigation needs a responsive hamburger menu for narrow viewports. Must include focus trapping when open and proper aria attributes for the toggle button.

### FEAT-006: Website CI/CD deployment pipeline

Set up automated builds and deployment for the website. Evaluate hosting options (Fly.io, Railway, or similar SSR-capable hosts).

## Chores

### CHORE-003: Migrate website to Rust 2024 edition

The website uses edition 2021 for cargo-leptos/wasm-bindgen compatibility. Once the toolchain supports it, migrate to edition 2024.

### CHORE-002: OpenGraph and social meta tags

Add og:title, og:description, og:image, and Twitter card meta tags to the website shell and per-page overrides via leptos_meta.

### FEAT-001: `dmn_create_input_type` helper

A convenience function that inspects a DMN model's input requirements for a given invocable and creates a matching PostgreSQL composite type automatically. This would eliminate the manual `CREATE TYPE` step when using `dmn_record_eval`.

Example usage:
```
SELECT dmn_create_input_type(dmn_load('<xml>'), 'Eligibility', 'eligibility_input');
-- Creates: CREATE TYPE eligibility_input AS ("Age" numeric, "Income" numeric)
```
